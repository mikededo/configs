# `@mikededo/configs`

This monorepo contains several `npm` packages that provide common configurations
for popular development tools like ESLint, Prettier, and more. By importing and
using these packages in your own projects, you can ensure that your code adheres
to consistent standards and best practices across your entire codebase. Th
configurations are strongly opinionated to my likings.

## Packages

The following packages are available in this monorepo:

- `@mikededo/eslint-config`: plain ESLint configuration, with TS support.
- `@mikededo/eslint-config-react`: ESLint configuration for React projects, with TS support.
